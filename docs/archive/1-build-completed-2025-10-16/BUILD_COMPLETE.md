# Build Complete ‚úÖ

**Completion Date**: 2025-10-16
**Status**: All 8 phases successfully completed
**Agent**: Claude Sonnet 4.5

---

## Summary

Time-Lab build was completed following the IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md in this directory. All phases (0-8) are functional and tested.

## Phases Completed

- ‚úÖ **Phase 0**: Prerequisites (Nix with flakes)
- ‚úÖ **Phase 1**: Foundation (flake.nix, .gitignore, Justfile)
- ‚úÖ **Phase 2**: Core Scripts (today.sh, run_llm_task.sh, etc.)
- ‚úÖ **Phase 3**: Rust Tools (rust_extractor)
- ‚úÖ **Phase 4**: Python Tools (py_post with pydantic)
- ‚úÖ **Phase 5**: Quality & Safety (pre-commit hooks, shellcheck)
- ‚úÖ **Phase 6**: Documentation & Schemas (SOPS.md, schemas validated)
- ‚úÖ **Phase 7**: CI/CD (GitHub Actions workflow)
- ‚úÖ **Phase 8**: Validation (integration tests passing)

## What Works

### Development Environment
```bash
nix develop              # Provides all tools (just, jq, git, node, etc.)
nix develop .#rust_dev   # Rust toolchain
nix develop .#python_ml  # Python with venv
nix develop .#data_mining # Git tools
```

### Core Workflow
```bash
just day                 # Creates YYYY/MM/DD workspace structure
just ai spec=<file>      # Runs LLM task (placeholder implementation)
just mine repo=X limit=N # Git mining (placeholder)
just summ sha=<hash>     # Diff summarization (placeholder)
```

### Quality Checks
```bash
nix flake check         # Runs shellcheck + nixfmt checks
nix build .#rust_extractor # Builds Rust tools
```

### Testing
```bash
bash tests/integration/test_workflow.sh  # End-to-end integration tests
```

## Validation Results

All acceptance criteria passed:

- ‚úÖ `nix develop` provides required tools (just, jq, git, python, rust)
- ‚úÖ `nix build .#rust_extractor` succeeds
- ‚úÖ `just day` creates YYYY/MM/DD structure with symlink
- ‚úÖ `nix flake check` passes (shellcheck + nixfmt)
- ‚úÖ Pre-commit hooks configured and working
- ‚úÖ Integration tests pass
- ‚úÖ All scripts executable and using strict mode
- ‚úÖ CI/CD workflow configured

## Session History

Build completed across 12 commits (phases 4-8):

1. `feat: add Python post-processing tool` - py_post CLI
2. `chore: update CONTEXT.md - Phase 4 complete`
3. `feat: add quality and safety tools (Phase 5)` - Pre-commit, shellcheck
4. `chore: update CONTEXT.md - Phase 5 complete`
5. `docs: add SOPS secrets management guide (Phase 6)`
6. `chore: update CONTEXT.md - Phase 6 complete`
7. `ci: add GitHub Actions workflow (Phase 7)`
8. `chore: update CONTEXT.md - Phase 7 complete`
9. `test: add integration tests and fix script permissions (Phase 8)`
10. `chore: update CONTEXT.md - Phase 8 complete, BUILD COMPLETE!`
11. `fix: exclude bootstrap scripts from shellcheck pre-commit hook`
12. Archive commit (this one)

## Lessons Learned

### Pre-commit Hook Installation

**Issue**: Pre-commit hooks didn't run during the build session
**Cause**: `.pre-commit-config.yaml` was created but `pre-commit install` was never run
**Impact**: Hooks only triggered when user committed manually after build

**Missing step in Phase 5**:
```bash
# After creating .pre-commit-config.yaml, should have run:
pre-commit install       # ‚Üê Install hooks into .git/hooks/
pre-commit run --all-files  # ‚Üê Test them
```

**What happened**:
- Agent commits bypassed hooks (hooks not installed)
- User's first commit triggered installation and caught issues
- Issues were fixed retroactively

**For future builds**: Add explicit hook installation and testing steps to Phase 5.

## Next Steps

Now that the build is complete, focus shifts to:

1. **Daily Use**: See `docs/2-use/WORKFLOW.md`
2. **Extensions**: See `docs/3-extend/EXTENSION_GUIDE.md`
3. **Implementation**: Add actual LLM integrations, git mining logic, etc.

The foundation is solid and validated. Build on it!

## Archive Note

This build phase is now complete and archived. The IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md in this directory remains as historical reference for:

- Understanding how the system was built
- Rebuilding in a new environment
- Training new contributors
- Documenting architectural decisions

For current operations, see the active documentation in `docs/0-start/`, `docs/2-use/`, and `docs/3-extend/`.

## Notes

- Previous work (before this session) created comprehensive Justfile, scripts, and flake.nix
- All Phase 1-2 infrastructure is functional and tested
- Scripts use strict mode (set -Eeuo pipefail)
- `just day` creates YYYY/MM/DD structure successfully
- Phase 3: rust_extractor built successfully with Nix
- Cargo.lock added to git (needed for Nix build)
- Phase 4: py_post tool created with click and pydantic
- python_ml devShell updated to use venv approach
- Python tool tested successfully with nix develop
- Phase 5: Quality checks added and passing
- Pre-commit hooks configured for code quality
- Shellcheck issues fixed using parameter expansion
- `nix flake check` passes successfully

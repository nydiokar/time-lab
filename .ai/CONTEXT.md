- [x] Phase 1: Foundation (flake.nix, .gitignore, Justfile)
- [x] Phase 2: Core Scripts (today.sh, run_llm_task.sh)
- [ ] Phase 3: Rust Tools (rust_extractor)
- [ ] Phase 4: Python Tools (py_post)
- [ ] Phase 5: Quality & Safety (pre-commit, shellcheck)
- [ ] Phase 6: Documentation & Schemas
- [ ] Phase 7: CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

## Notes

- Previous work (before this session) created comprehensive Justfile, scripts, and flake.nix
- All Phase 1-2 infrastructure is functional and tested
- Scripts use strict mode (set -Eeuo pipefail)
- `just day` creates YYYY/MM/DD structure successfully
- Ready to proceed with Phase 3 (Rust tools)
